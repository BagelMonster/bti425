## Development environment setup

This document is intended for someone who is starting BTI425 without having a credit in the BTI325 prerequisite. 

<br>

### Introduction

We setup the development environment on a laptop or desktop computer. 

After we are finished creating an app, we deploy it to a hosting environment, so that public users can use it. 

<br>

### Node.js and npm

It all starts with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm. They work together. When you download and install Node.js, the procedure also downloads and installs npm.
