## Client apps that use a web API

This brief document has information about client apps that use a web API. Both use the new-ish Fetch API. 

There are two client apps:
1. An app for the browser 
2. Another for Node.js 

Get the apps from [the course's code example repository](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425).

Open each app and interact. Your device must have an internet connection when using the apps.
