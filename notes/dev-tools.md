### Web dev work is done on a Unix

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux. The [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) feature is recommended, along with a Windows Store version of Linux (e.g. [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)). 

> Important - We *expect* you to do your work on macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like operating system.
