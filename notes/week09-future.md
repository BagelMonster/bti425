#### Continue work on Assignment 2

<mark>update</mark>

[Assignment 2](/graded-work/assign2) has been posted. 

This organization scheme is discussed in the MongoDB documentation article:  
[Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/)

> Note - that area of the documentation has other useful articles, some of which we will use during our work on Assignment 2. 

Your professors will provide you with starter data that can be used in Assignment 2. Some of that data is ready now, and is located in the [week 8 folder](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425/tree/master/Week_08) of the code repo. Get the `assign-2-data-student-v1.json` data file and study it, comparing it to the description above. 

The remaining time in the class/session can be used by you to get started on Assignment 2.
