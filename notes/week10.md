## BTI425 Week 10 Notes

This week, we will make progress with *forms* topics.  

<br>

### Topics

Highlights from this week's topics: 

Last week we were introduced to [Angular template-driven forms](angular-forms-intro). It's time to learn more. 

> Remember our previous coverage of  
> [HTML Form patterns](html-form-patterns). 

The course's GitHub repo has a nice [code example](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425/tree/master/Week_10) that covers the typical CRUD tasks. 

Then, we'll learn some techniques to improve the interaction experience users have with forms. And, we'll introduce data validation techniques. These topics are covered in this document:  
[Introduction to Angular template-driven forms validation](angular-forms-validation-intro)
