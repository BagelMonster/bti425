## BTI425 Week 10 Notes

This week, we will make progress with *forms* topics.  

<br>

### Topics

Highlights from this week's topics: 

Last week we were introduced to [Angular template-driven forms](angular-forms-intro). It's time to learn more. 

The course's GitHub repo has a nice [code example](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425/tree/master/Week_10) that covers the typical CRUD tasks. 

Then, we'll learn some techniques to improve the interaction experience users have with forms. And, we'll introduce data validation techniques.
